-- Answers two questions:
--   1. Which migrations have actually taken effect?
--   2. Is there existing data that would stop 0004 from applying?
-- =====================================================================


-- 1. Which migrations are in place -------------------------------------

-- Expect: policies 30+, every other column 1, and all three m0006_* columns = true.
-- Those have no separate object to count — 0006 only CREATE OR REPLACEs
-- existing functions — so the live functions' own source is the only proof.
-- (The claim_only_for_self and unassigned_reply_broadcast checks require the
-- amended 0006 from the follow-up review pass — re-run 0006 if either reads
-- false on a database where 0006 was already applied once before.)
-- Expect: policies 30+, and 1 in every other column.
-- A 0 in an m0004_ column means 0004 has not applied.


-- 2. Rows that would block 0004's constraints ---------------------------
-- Every count must be 0. Anything above 0 is data written before the rule
-- existed; 0004 now repairs these automatically, so this is only here to
-- show you what it will touch.

-- 3. Accounts and roles -------------------------------------------------

  p.created_at
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN public.profiles p ON p.id = u.id

LIMIT 25;

-- missing when that account was created. Delete the user and re-register.


-- 4. Notification queue health -----------------------------------------
SELECT status, count(*) AS count, max(attempts) AS max_attempts
FROM public.notifications

ORDER BY status;
-- Anything sitting in 'dead_letter' means the worker gave up. Usually the
-- sending domain is not verified in Resend.
